# Contributing to The Art of Tech: Not Playing with a Full Tech community

## Contributing

When contributing to this repository, please first discuss the change you wish to make via issue,
email, discussion or any other method with the owners of this repository before making a change.

Please note we have a CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md, CODESTYLE.md and DEVSETUP.md within this repository.  Please review and follow them in all your interactions with the project.

## Pull Request Process

1. Ensure any install or build dependencies are removed before the end of the layer when doing a
   build.

2. Update the CHANGELOG.nd with details of changes

3. Increase the version numbers in any examples files and the README.md to the new version that this
   Pull Request would represent. The versioning scheme we use is [SemVer](http://semver.org/).

4. You may merge the Pull Request in once you have the sign-off of at least one other developer, or if you
   do not have permission to do that, you may request the second reviewer to merge it for you.

Some things to think about:

1. Respect peoples' time.

2. Provide constructive feedback.

3. State exactly what needs to be improved.

4. Don't just pray or hope that the code works.

5. Be reasonable about `Temporary` code, it may or may not make it to final.

6. Big Picture your request. Remember, Code is not the line you write, but how the line integrates with and provides benefit to the application itself.

7. Review the code in chunks of 200-400 lines at the most.

8. Add comments on your pull request to help guide the reviewer

9. Make it visual if possible. Add some screenshots if you believe that will help.

## Code Review Process

We will be implementing a code review process to be described here.  Your code will have to pass CI/CD checks as well as reviews by a minimum of one maintainer/reviewer.
