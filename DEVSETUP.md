# Development Setup Guide

This guide is for the people that would like to contribute to taotnpwaft and do it well.

While we use VSCode and Visual Studio 2019, but you can use whatever IDE you prefer.

Please have a read on [CODESTYLE.md](CODESTYLE.md), any code that does not apply to these rules will not get merged.
