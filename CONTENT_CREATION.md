# Content Creation Guidelines

* Target Community Member

    Our community could be made up of email subscribers, social media followers, push notification subscribers, podcast subscribers, commenters, etc.

* Content

    Which topics should I write about?
    How in-depth do I need to go?
    How often should I publish new blog posts?
    What content will make my audience take action instead of just passively read?

    What is our goal(s) for content for the tech community?  What type of product do we have?  Do we offer a solution, ie tech support, news, blog, podcast, VOD's (YouTube, Twitch, etc.)

    Our needs will be to be able to easily understand what our product is, why it’s special and why it matters to our community and the rest of the tech community as a whole.”
