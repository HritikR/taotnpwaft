## Pull Request Process

1. Ensure any install or build dependencies are removed before the end of the layer when doing a
   build.

2. Update the CHANGELOG.nd with details of changes

3. Increase the version numbers in any examples files and the README.md to the new version that this
   Pull Request would represent. The versioning scheme we use is [SemVer](http://semver.org/).
4. You may merge the Pull Request in once you have the sign-off of at least one other developer, or if you
   do not have permission to do that, you may request the second reviewer to merge it for you.

## Code Review Process

We will be implementing a code review process to be described here.  Your code will have to pass CI/CD checks as well as reviews by a minimum of one maintainer/reviewer.
