# Discord Channels Cleanup

## The Art of Tech - Meta

* `code-of-conduct` - Rename to #Rules. Rules must be "Accepted" by "emoji" list of rules before other channels open up and allow posting.

  - I chose the Contributor Covenant guidelines for conduct.  See CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md for the Contributor Covenant text. 

* `the-art-of-tech-guidelines` - REMOVE. Not valid/required
  
- This was a channel with our own set of Group and/or Discord rules over and above the Contributor Coventant as above.

* `about-this-server` - REMOVE. Not valid/required

  - Most of the Discord's I have been in or currently in, have some sort of About channel that is closed, whether it be a FAQ, some historical text, etc.

## Welcome

* `announcements` - Limit to BOT posting only. Should not be used by admins for chat and replies. Use a BOT Command to post an annoucement to channel.
 I have only used this channel to announce major group updates.

* `Introduce-yourself-here` - Rename to #Introductions. Limit who can post here to NEW memebrs only. Once new users have posted in this channel and accepted the rules allow posting in other channels?
  
 - Not many people have posted their Intros.
  
* `taot-youtube` - Rename to #YouTube. Having taot is a bit redundant. Limit this to BOT postings as well to announce new videos uploaded to our YouTube Channel.
  
* `taot-polls` - REMOVE. Use the #announcements channel to announce Polls.
  
 - Ok

## Live Streams

* `livestream-schedule` - Rename to #schedule. Having livestream in channel name is redundant. Limit to BOT postings/announcements for when Stream goes Live.

 - Ok
  
* `livestream-discussions`- Rename to #discussions or #livestream.

 - Ok.  

* `streaming-now` - Remove. Redundant channel when you have schedule above.

 - This is a channel for bots and or members who stream to announce their live streams.  We do have several Twitch and or YouTube streamers, theDabolical and Splashley and Amigagod stream on Twitch.  I have not looked into the Bot/Automation that could announce their streams the moment they go live.

## General channels

* `general` - Keep as is. Main chat channel. 

 - Ok. 
  
* `off-topic-discussion` - Rename to #OffTopic or #Off-Topic. Maybe even remove. Tends to be redundant as most of the conversations happen in General.

 - This channel was meant to have anything on it that isn't  
  
* `stuff-youve-bought` - Rename to #LabPorn. I like this "flair". Stolen from /r/homelab.

 - Ok. Decent idea.

* `bot-chatter` - Remove. This is redundant as bot chatter should be in private messages to user or directly in channel command requested.

* `channel-suggestion-box` - Keep as is. Nothing needed on this channel.

 - This was meant for members to suggest new Discord channels, though I really doubt we need new channels.

* `taot-group-suggestions` - Remove. Redundant channel as we have above channel.
  
  - This channel was meant to provide a means for people to share group suggestions.  I don't know if we are big enough yet.

* `tech-news` - Keep as is or remove? Posting articles of tech news and discussions. But most people tend to just use #General. So maybe we should remove it?
  
 - This was used in the beginning of the Discord for sharing tech news/ articles.

* `vehicle-tech` - Remove. Dead Channel.

 - Ok. 
 - 
* `tech-memes` - Keep as is. Good for a laugh.  
 
  - I usually am against sharing Meme's but this was a member request becuase at least 1 person was posting Meme's to the #general channel.

## Programming


* `generalprogrammingchat` - Rename #General or #GeneralProgramming

* `webprogrammingchat` - Rename #WebProgramming or #WebLanguages.  We might need a channel to discuss our Website though.  

* `javascript-programming` - Remove. Redundant when web and general are above.

* `react-dev` - Remove. Dead Channel.
  
  I only added this channel because I have been working with @idormain on my REACT project RadioLogger.  

* `GeneralProgramming` - Remove Voice Channel
  
 - Occasionally, I screen share development. The only way you can currently do screen share in Discord is to use a Voice Channel and click share screen button.

## Administrative

- `pvtchanneladmin` - Keep as is?  
  
  This was a channel meant for private discussion of group administrative elements, not meant for out in the open discussion.

* `admin` - Keep as is.

 Ok.1

* `moderator` - Keep as is.

 Ok.

* `support` - Keep as is. 

 Ok

## Technology

* `retro-tech` - Keep. Maybe rename to #Retro
  
 - This was a channel meant for Amigagod (and a few others) to post stuff about Retro tech and old computers.  This has not had much activity, ever.

* `tech_youtube-Channel` - Rename to #Video-Tech-Channels
  
 I almost think it would be a better idea to rather have an accessible and searchable database of all of the tech streamers/twitch/youtube channels, big or small.  

* `homelab-and-home-networking` - Rename to #homelab
  
 - Good idea, Ok.

* `tech_twitch-channels` - Remove. Redundant now with renamed video channel above.
  
  - With more and more streamers streaming either Science and Technology and/or Software and Game Development on Twitch 

* `tech_lbry-channels` - Remove. Dead and redundant.  

 - Yes this is sort of redundant. 

## Servers

Remove this category and channels. Most of these questions would fall under #Homelab anyway.

## Linux

* `distrotalk` - Keep as is.  

 - This channel was meant for posting new distro releases and for discussing particular distros.
  
* `linux-help` - Keep as is.

## Tech support

Keep all channels as is.  

I am not sure how we will implement a tech support system for members.  Ideally I'd like for the group to provide some limited tech support. 

## Communications

Keep all channels as is.

 - We do have several radio operators

## UNIX & BSD's

Remove this category and channels. Redundant as we have Linux above and all fall under same category.

- Ok

## Virtualization 

Keep as is. As we grow, move specific channels can be added later. such as #Proxmox #vmWare #Hyper-V etc. But just the #general channel is fine for now.
