Welcome to the Alt F4 Discord!

Before we break down the server rules, everyone here would like to thank you for joining our family. We treat this server & community like our home, and as a result we’ve been able to cultivate one of the most (if not the most) amazing communities on Twitch. This community is a direct result of the type of people we encourage to participate and the rules we keep in place within the community; these rules we ask each and everyone of you to adhere to and follow.

#1. Be a nice, respectful person. Simple right? 
We know that within all communities there are situations that may arise where tensions flair; just do your part in maintaining the peace and reach out to one of the @Moderators or to @AToTA and/or @blackglasses. 

#2. Do not spam!
Everyone is allowed to post to their heart's content, just don’t make it excessive.

#3. Post content in the correct channels.
Not doing so will not result in a ban, just a possibility that the post will be deleted from the wrong channel.

#4. The Sending/Linking of any harmful material such as viruses, IP trackers or malicious links and/or the posting of someone's personal information will result in an immediate and permanent ban hammer.

#5. Be considerate of the language you use on this server. 
Cursing will not result in a ban; however, excessively extreme & inappropriate language is prohibited.

#6. Act civil in Voice Chat.
Voice chat is harder to moderate than a text channel, so Rule #1 applies here as well. If any issues arise within any voice channel, again just do your part in maintaining the peace and reach out to one of the  @Moderators or to @AToTA and/or @blackglasses. 

#7. All of Discord's Terms of Service apply to this discord server. https://discord.com/guidelines 

This discord server is a place for discussion about :st: Sublime Text (https://sublimetext.com/) and :sm: Sublime Merge (https://sublimemerge.com/). 
We do have a couple rules in place, but they are not hard to follow. Violations of the rules may result in a warning, kick, or ban, based on severity.

1. Use civil language. Our community is open to everyone and does not need profanity of any form.
2. Keep the discussions on-topic, where possible, and use the appropriate channels. Use 
off-topic for other inquiries.
3. No sensitive content whatsoever.
(4. Don't ask to ask, just ask.)

Note that inactive members (for 30 days) are semi-regularly pruned. Feel free to join again. 


Rules for this discord are easy. Be kind, no negativity, keep this discord as a place for all of us to hang out knowing there will be no negativity. 

Welcome to Splashley's Discord. Please read the rules.

Treat everyone with respect. Absolutely no harassment, witch hunting, sexism, racism, or hate speech will be tolerated.

No NSFW or obscene content. This includes text, images, or links featuring nudity, sex, hard violence, or other graphically disturbing content.

No spam or self-promotion (server invites, advertisements, MLMs, etc) without permission from a staff member. This includes DMing fellow members.

No bashing members for their language/framework/library choices and experience level.

Please speak only English or French in this Discord.

If you see something against the rules or something that makes you feel unsafe, please message Splashley directly or the Mods. We want this server to be a welcoming space! 

- Just behave and dont do to anyone what you dont want done to you! 
- Never read what i write, understand what i mean!

:florp:  Florpsylvania :florp: 
This is a friendly community, if you made it here, you already know that more than likely.

📜 Rules 📜
There isn't much in the way of hard concrete rules, at least nothing that should need explained. Should something need to be directly addressed it will get amended here or in a following post.

⛔ Do not post Porn or other explicit material, this is an all ages server, there will be no NSFW channels.

👮 Admin & Moderators 👮
The people with orange names are admins and moderators. If you are experiencing some sort of trouble with the server, or otherwise have helpful suggestions or ideas, these are the people to contact.
If another user of this server is causing problems on this server or with you or another user of this server, please let us know ASAP so it can be addressed.

💬 Channels 💬
Please try to keep topics of discussion somewhat relevant to the channel they are in or move to one of the more generic channels.

📨 Unsolicited Scam/Spam/Sales 📨
If you message the members of this server(ping or directly) or the server with these things, you will be banned immediately.
If you receive a direct message like this, check the senders profile for mutual servers, if this one shows up, notify an Admin. 

This server is generally SFW (Safe-For-Work content).  Strong language is allowed in the course of regular conversation on all channels.  💩 Shitposts belong in 

    chaotic-vibes.  BUT hate towards any person or group/ doxxing/ harassment/ nudity are never tolerated.  PLEASE NO DRAMA.


❔ Questions?:

    Please post in the channel 

ask-mods.  If you need urgent help related to disallowed content, reply to the problem message and tag @Mods//Discord or @Mods//Twitch-+*/-*+

Welcome to the OdatNurd Discord! This is a place to chat with me and discuss things like videos on my YouTube channel :youtube: (https://youtube.com/c/OdatNurd), my
Twitch channel :twitch: (https://www.twitch.tv/odatnurd) and my Sublime Text packages :sublime: (https://packagecontrol.io/browse/authors/OdatNurd).

The rules here are low key and easy to follow; depending on the severity, a rules violation may result in a warning, kick or ban.

1. Be excellent to each other. Lets keep the conversations civil and family friendly.
2. Use the appropriate channel for questions or discussion. Sometimes conversations evolve as they go on and the initial location may no longer be appropriate, but having things in the appropriate place makes them easier to find later.
3. You don't have to ask if you can ask a question; ask away!

Learn With Leon & Friends Discord Rules

Breaking these set of rules will result in an instant Kick or Ban from the server

🚨 No NSFW images or context
This server should be safe for everyone. Any NSFW pictures and discussions will result in an instant ban.

🚨No illegal discussion
This includes any discussion about illegal drugs or activities, as well as hacking and piracy.

🚨No ban evading
Ban evading is using a VPN or even just another account to join the server and continue participating after you’ve been banned.

🚨 No discrimination
This includes using racist terms/slang, sexist or ableist terms or making others feel bad for their race, gender, sexuality or disability. See more in our community guidelines below.

🚨No advertising
Advertising your or others youtube, twitch, discord or social media does not belong in this server.

🚨Don't ignore your warnings or mutes
If you have been warned we suggest you make changes to improve your behavior so it doesn’t happen again! And if you’ve been muted please don’t use other accounts to talk in the chat, or other people to talk for you. Wait patiently for your mute to be over. 
----

Chat etiquette

Breaking these two rules can result in a permanent ban

🚨 Be kind to one another. Be the type of person who stays positive and gives people the benefit of the doubt. See the best in people. Embrace diversity: of backgrounds, of perspective, of those things we can choose, and those we can’t. Accept your own failures, and those of your peers, as an important part of the process.

🚨Ask yourself
Is this the most supportive message I can send in this moment? If not, please choose a new message!

Breaking these set of rules will get you a warning. Getting 3 warnings will lead to a permanent ban

🚨No abuse
Do not abuse other players, avoid name calling, cursing or saying things others may find offensive. A good rule of thumb is if you wouldn’t say it to someone’s face then don’t say it here!

🚨No toxic behaviour
Excessive passive-aggressiveness, back talking other members, putting others down regularly and just being a not-kind person is considered ‘toxic’. Avoid that!

🚨No spam
Avoid sending the same message multiple times within the span of a few minutes. This rule includes emoticon spam and letter spam!

🚨No streaming games or off-topic stuff (unless in the hangout channels)
The voice channels streaming feature should only be used for sharing code or helping people learn

🚨No witch hunting
Do not publicly call out people and/or harass them for their misbehavior! If you catch another member breaking the rules, don't take it into your hands, report them privately via ModMail and let a mod take care of it

❤️ Community Guidelines ❤️

Our Goal

This community is dedicated to providing a harassment-free experience for everyone. We do not tolerate harassment of participants in any form.

Applicability and Scope

This code of conduct applies to all of this community's spaces, including public channels, private channels and direct messages, both online and off. Anyone who violates this code of conduct may be sanctioned or expelled from these spaces at the discretion of the administrators.

Toward a Welcoming and Safe Environment

We hope to create an environment in which diverse individuals can collaborate and interact in a positive and affirming way. Examples of behavior that contributes to creating this sort of environment include:

•Using welcoming and inclusive language
•Being respectful of differing viewpoints and experiences
•Gracefully accepting constructive criticism
•Focusing on what is best for the overall community
•Showing empathy towards other community members
---
Anti-Harassment Statement

This community will not tolerate harassment of any kind. Examples of harassment include:

•Offensive comments related to gender, gender identity and expression, sexual orientation, disability, mental illness, neuro(a)typicality, physical appearance, pregnancy status, veteran status, political affiliation, marital status, body size, age, race, national origin, ethnic origin, nationality, immigration status, language, religion or lack thereof, or other identity marker. This includes anti-Indigenous/Nativeness and anti-Blackness.
•Unwelcome comments regarding a person's lifestyle choices and practices, including those related to food, health, parenting, relationships, drugs, and employment.
•Deliberate misgendering, using inappropriate pronouns, or use of "dead" or rejected names.
•Gratuitous or off-topic sexual images or behavior in spaces where they're not appropriate.
•Physical contact and simulated physical contact (eg, textual descriptions like "hug" or "backrub") without consent or after a request to stop.
•Threats of violence.
•Incitement of violence towards any individual or group, including encouraging a person to commit suicide or to engage in self-harm.
•Deliberate intimidation.
•Stalking or following - online or in the physical world.
•Harassing photography or recording, including logging online activity for harassment purposes.
•Sustained disruption of discussion.
•Unwelcome sexual attention.
•Unwelcome requests to connect especially off of discord. 
•Patterns of inappropriate social contact, such as requesting/assuming inappropriate levels of intimacy with others.
•Continued one-on-one communication after requests to cease.
•Deliberate "outing" of any aspect of a person's identity without their consent except as necessary to protect vulnerable people from intentional abuse.
•Publication of non-harassing private communication. 
•Jokes that resemble the above, such as "hipster racism", still count as harassment even if meant satirically or ironically.

If you have questions or concerns about these issues please feel free to message an admin or ask for an opportunity to explore the issue with a moderator and volunteers. 
---

Reporting

If you are being harassed by a member of our community, notice that someone else is being harassed, or have any other concerns, please contact the moderators via ModMail. If the person who is harassing you is on the admin team, they will not be involved in handling or resolving the incident.

The admin team will respond to any complaint as promptly as possible we can. If you do not get a timely response (for example, if no admins are currently online) then please put your personal safety and well-being first, and consider logging out and/or contacting the admins by email at leon@leonnoel.com

This code of conduct applies to our community's spaces, but if you are being harassed by a member of our community outside our spaces, we still want to know about it. We will take all good-faith reports of harassment by our members, especially the administrators, seriously. This includes harassment outside our spaces and harassment that took place at any point in time. The abuse team reserves the right to exclude people from the community based on their past behavior, including behavior outside of our spaces and behavior towards people who are not in this community.

In order to protect volunteers from abuse and burnout, we reserve the right to reject any report we believe to have been made in bad faith. Reports intended to silence legitimate criticism may be deleted without response.
---

Enforcement Process

Every code of conduct violation report will be treated with seriousness and care. If a member's immediate safety and security is threatened, an individual admin may take any action that they deem appropriate, up to and including temporarily banning the offender from the community. In less urgent situations, at least two admins will discuss the offense and mutually arrive at a suitable response, which will be shared with the offender privately. Whatever the resolution that they decide upon, the decision of the admins involved in a violation case will be considered final.

We will respect confidentiality requests for the purpose of protecting victims of abuse. At our discretion, we may publicly name a person about whom we've received harassment complaints, or privately warn third parties about them, if we believe that doing so will increase the safety of our members or the general public. We will not name harassment victims without their affirmative consent.
---

Consequences

Participants asked to stop any harassing behavior are expected to comply immediately. If a participant engages in harassing behavior, the administrators may take any action they deem appropriate, up to and including expulsion from the community and identification of the participant as a harasser to other members. At the discretion of the admins, or by request, one or more of the parties involved may request to discuss the violation and how to avoid similar situations in the future.

Welcome to The RavaLair!
Please take a moment to read the #🚫rules before getting started!

1. Follow the T.O.S
  - https://discordapp.com/terms

2. Treat everyone with respect

3. Keep all content PG-13 & English

4. The following topics & actions are prohibited:
  - Begging/asking for financial support, items or jobs
  - Spamming
  - Excessive trolling
  - Racial slur
  - Personal attacks
  - Anything against T.O.S.

5. Any other actions that cause problems will be dealt with as necessary
  * Just because it's not specifically listed here doesn't mean it's allowed, avoid any drama and negativity for the sake of the community
  * We judge each and every situation individually and take action based on the severity and regularity of an offense

This being said, Admininstrative decisions are FINAL!

6. Contact @ImDarkk if you believe you were treated unfairly. 
﻿

Updated rules are as follows:

Intolerance is not welcome
It is a goal of this server to have an increasingly diverse membership. That said, personal attacks of any kind will not be tolerated. 

Keep topics SFW
There are plenty of Discord servers for sex, nudity, drug use, and violence. This is not one. 
Self promotion only in the proper channel
Got a cool project or stream you want to share? You’re welcome to in 
self-promotion, but no other channels. 

Don’t cheat on schoolwork
Academic dishonesty won’t be tolerated. If it seems like you’re asking people to do your schoolwork for you, that’s an issue.

Put effort in before asking for help
If someone says they are willing to help, they are doing you a kindness. You need to have at least tried to solve the problem first. If you need a starting point, that’s what #deleted-channel is for. 

Follow Discord Community Guidelines
There are found here: https://discordapp.com/guidelines

When in doubt, be kind
Generally speaking, if you’re rude, you’re not welcome here. 


Adding yourself to roles
Some roles are available for you to add yourself to! Head over to the 
add-me-to-role channel and use the .roles command to see a list of every role on the server. You won’t be able to add yourself to all of them, but you can use the .iam command to add yourself to the available ones. For example, .iam Python will add you to the @Python role, and you will be notified whenever someone tags that role for help or discussions!

Got an idea for a role? Put it in the 
feedback channel!

Welcome to the server and thank you for joining!  

RULES:

1. Don't be a dick, a bit of banter is fine. But, theres a fine line between banter and being a dick. You will be banned.

2. No self promotion. Youtube, Twitch, Discord etc.

3. Do not disclose personal information of another member or person, without their permission. Doxing etc, will not be tolerated.

4. No asking for code related homework help.

5. Exhaust all your resources before asking other developers for help, ie look on google or youtube. - It's unfair for developers to spend their time helping you, if you didn't even bother to help your self.


Breaking these rules will either result in a temporary mute, a kick or a ban. We do not need to justify our selves to you, be nice to the community, respect each other and lets all enjoy our lives.


KEEP IN MIND:

- If you do not use the code-assistance or #extended-code-assistance channel, and instead pm myself, a member of staff or anybody with the @Developer role, then expect to pay their rates. The channel is there for community assistance, we can all pitch together to solve your problem. Rather than putting it onto one person. Also said person you pm, may not be available.

-  Don't ask when stream will be. If you want to know when I'll stream, there will be a notification in Discord and if you follow my Twitch, you'll get a notification via the Twitch app on your phone. Simple.


EXTRA INFORMATION:
- If you're a Twitch Sub, be sure to connect your account to Discord to get benefits.
- If you're a Twitch Sub, be sure to use #extended-code-assistance for any code help, instead of the standard channel.
- You can use /roles to get developer, devops role etc
- You can use /preferences to hide certain channels/disable bot dms
