# Discord Channels Cleanup

## The Art of Tech - Meta

* `code-of-conduct` - Rename to #Rules. Rules must be "Accepted" by "emoji" list of rules before other channels open up and allow posting.
* `the-art-of-tech-guidelines` - REMOVE. Not valid/required
* `about-this-server` - REMOVE. Not valid/required

## Welcome

* `announcements` - Limit to BOT posting only. Should not be used by admins for chat and replies. Use a BOT Command to post an annoucement to channel.
* `Introduce-yourself-here` - Rename to #Introductions. Limit who can post here to NEW memebrs only. Once new users have posted in this channel and accepted the rules allow posting in other channels?
* `taot-youtube` - Rename to #YouTube. Having taot is a bit redundant. Limit this to BOT postings as well to announce new videos uploaded to our YouTube Channel.
* `taot-pools` - REMOVE. Use the #announcements channel to announce Polls.

## Live Streams

* `livestream-schedule` - Rename to #schedule. Having livestream in channel name is redundant. Limit to BOT postings/announcements for when Stream goes Live.
* `livestream-discussions`- Rename to #discussions or #livestream.
* `streaming-now` - Remove. Redundant channel when you have schedule above.

## General channels

* `general` - Keep as is. Main chat channel.
* `off-topic-discussion` - Rename to #OffTopic or #Off-Topic. Maybe even remove. Tends to be redundant as most of the conversations happen in General.
* `stuff-youve-bought` - Rename to #LabPorn. I like this "flair". Stolen from /r/homelab.
* `bot-chatter` - Remove. This is redundant as bot chatter should be in private messages to user or directly in channel command requested.
* `channel-suggestion-box` - Keep as is. Nothing needed on this channel.
* `taot-group-suggestions` - Remove. Redundant channel as we have above channel.
* `tech-news` - Keep as is or remove? Posting articles of tech news and discussions. But most people tend to just use #General. So maybe we should remove it?
* `vehicle-tech` - Remove. Dead Channel.
* `tech-memes` - Keep as is. Good for a laugh.

## Programming

* `generalprogrammingchat` - Rename #General or #GeneralProgramming
* `webprogrammingchat` - Rename #WebProgramming or #WebLanguages
* `javascript-programming` - Remove. Redundant when web and general are above.
* `react-dev` - Remove. Dead Channel.
* `GeneralProgramming` - Remove Voice Channel

## Administrative

* `moderator` - Keep as is.
* `support` - Keep as is.

## Technology

* `retro-tech` - Keep. Maybe rename to #Retro
* `tech_youtube-Channel` - Rename to #Video-Tech-Channels
* `homelab-and-home-networking` - Rename to #homelab
* `tech_twitch-channels` - Remove. Redundant now with renamed video channel above.
* `tech_lbry-channels` - Remove. Dead and redundant.

## Servers

Remove this category and channels. Most of these questions would fall under #Homelab anyway.

## Linux

* `distrotalk` - Keep as is.
* `linux-help` - Keep as is.

## Tech support

Keep all channels as is

## Communications

Keep all channels as is.

## UNIX & BSD's

Remove this category and channels. Redundant as we have Linux above and all fall under same category.

## Virtualization.

Keep as is. As we grow move specific channels can be added later. such as #Proxmox #vmWare #Hyper-V etc. But just the #general channel is fine for now.
