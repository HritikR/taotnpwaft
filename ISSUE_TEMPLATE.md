* This is the `blank-issue-template' used in the Github workflow used when you click on the Issues tab and loads when you click on the link next to the text:

[Don't see your issue here? Open a blank issue.]

If you set blank_issues_enabled to true in the `/ISSUE_TEMPLATE/config.yml`, people will have the option to open a blank issue. See the `config.yml` in the ISSUE_TEMPLATE folder.

Because this repository is mostly .md files and documentation, I don't know what will work best.
