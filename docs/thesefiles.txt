These files are moslty Github related repository files, especially any of the .md (markdown) files and YAML .yml files especially in .github/

The /website folder is for permanent storage of the group website

I would like to look into how the OpenGovernment does their documentation process for their group.

Aparently also the /docs/ folder is used for Jeckyll sites/pages.
